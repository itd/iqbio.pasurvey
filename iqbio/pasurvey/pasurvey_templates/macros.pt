          <h3>Three Degree Programs of Interest</h3>
          <p>In May of your first year, you will formally choose which degree program
            you would like to pursue a PhD in. In order to streamline that process,
            we are asking that you choose three potential
            degree programs now (from which you will choose one after your first year), so that
            each degree program may "pre-approve" your application. You must be pre-approved by two
            different degree programs, or significantly different disciplines within one program,
            to be accepted into the IQ Biology program.
          </p>
          <p>You will formally fill out an application on CU's Graduate School
            Application website for your "First Degree Program of Interest";
            IQ Biology will pass along your application to your other
            degree programs of interest. You will only have to fill out one
            application and pay one fee and it does not matter in what order
            of interest you ranked them on this application.
